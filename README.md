Video games have always been an integral part of my life. The true magic of these experiences, however, lies in the shared moments of adventure—teaming up with siblings and friends, where laughter and shouts of victory mingled together beyond the screen.

This powerful connection between people and games drives my passion for the intersection of **gaming and AI**. I am fascinated by the potential of advanced AI technologies and algorithms to create interactive agents that are not merely digital opponents but genuine companions in a gaming experience.
